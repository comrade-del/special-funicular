# special-funicular
little client-server applet(?) with python. Displays geopolitical zone of given state in Nigeria

I used Sqlite for the database, Socket for the connection between client and server, then Tkinter and CustomTkinter for the GUI.

main.py is with plain tkinter, statezonse.py is with customtkinter, db.py is the database manipulation code (also runs as a console app), and polserv.py is the server file
